            <h3>Artificial Stimulation and Perception</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I am interested in reducing the gap between natural and artificial sensory stimuli—specifically, in designing artificial neural activity that mimics the structure, dynamics, and perceptual meaning of naturally evoked signals. By studying how the brain represents precise sensory inputs, my goal is to identify the features of neural activity that make a stimulus feel ‘natural’ to the organism and determine how artificial stimulation can be engineered to align with these biological codes. This work has implications for sensory prosthetics, neural decoding, and the broader question of how the brain constructs perception.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                To compare artificial spatiotemporal activity patterns with natural sensory stimuli, I redesigned and improved a behavioral paradigm that measures perceptual distance in mice, extending it to quantify how animals perceive artificially induced sequences while preserving their natural stimulus judgments within the same sessions.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                In the same sessions, mice were able to discriminate the similarity of natural odors and evaluate the perceptual distance of artificially induced neural sequences. This demonstrates that animals generalized the decision rule learned with odorants to artificial spatiotemporal patterns, treating them as meaningful sensory inputs rather than novel or irrelevant signals. To test the limits of this paradigm, animals were also challenged to discriminate single activation spots approximately the size of a single glomerulus. Even under these minimal conditions, mice maintained high performance on natural odors and were able to discriminate certain pairs of light spots, demonstrating the sensitivity and resolution of the behavioral paradigm without requiring additional extensive training.
