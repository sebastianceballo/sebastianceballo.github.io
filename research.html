        <h1>Artificial Stimulation and Perception</h1>

            <h3>Measurement of perceptual distances in Mice</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I am interested in reducing the gap between natural and artificial sensory stimuli—specifically, in designing artificial neural activity that mimics the structure, dynamics, and perceptual meaning of naturally evoked signals. By studying how the brain represents precise sensory inputs, my goal is to identify the features of neural activity that make a stimulus feel ‘natural’ to the organism and determine how artificial stimulation can be engineered to align with these biological codes. This work has implications for sensory prosthetics, neural decoding, and the broader question of how the brain constructs perception.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                To compare artificial spatiotemporal activity patterns with natural sensory stimuli, I redesigned and improved a behavioral paradigm that measures perceptual distance in mice, extending it to quantify how animals perceive artificially induced sequences while preserving their natural stimulus judgments within the same sessions.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                In the same sessions, mice were able to discriminate the similarity of natural odors and evaluate the perceptual distance of artificially induced neural sequences. This demonstrates that animals generalized the decision rule learned with odorants to artificial spatiotemporal patterns, treating them as meaningful sensory inputs rather than novel or irrelevant signals. To test the limits of this paradigm, animals were also challenged to discriminate single activation spots approximately the size of a single glomerulus. Even under these minimal conditions, mice maintained high performance on natural odors and were able to discriminate certain pairs of light spots, demonstrating the sensitivity and resolution of the behavioral paradigm without requiring additional extensive training.

            <h3>DMTS traning procedure</h3>
            <p>
            Cranial Window Preparation and Optical Access:
                For each animal, a cranial window was implanted over the dorsal olfactory bulb to allow optical access to glomeruli. Panel A shows a representative cranial window in which individual glomeruli are clearly visible under blue-light illumination. [Insert details regarding wavelength, illumination source, power at the sample, and imaging setup.
            Phase 1: Light-Spot Training:
                Mice were initially trained using a single optogenetic light spot delivered sequentially with a 3-s interstimulus interval. Each light pulse had a duration of 10 ms. Training continued until animals reliably responded to the light stimulus.
                Across sessions, I identified light-spot locations that elicited behavioral responses in >80% of trials. These reliably detected locations were used for subsequent training phases.
            Phase 2: Introduction of Odor-Match Trials:
                After completing Phase 1, mice were introduced to odorant trials presented under match conditions. Light and odor trials were interleaved but never presented simultaneously.
                Animals rapidly learned to respond appropriately to both light and odor stimuli. Phase 2 was considered complete when mice achieved high accuracy on both light-match and odor-match trials.
            Phase 3: Introduction of Odor Non-Match Trials:
                In Phase 3, odor non-match trials were introduced. Trial probabilities were set to 50% for light- or odor-match trials and 50% for odor non-match trials.
